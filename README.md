# gql-plants - GraphQL API with json-server

Welcome to the gql-plants project, a GraphQL API that uses json-server as a database.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following requirements installed before getting started:

- Node.js > 18: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Yarn (an alternative package manager to npm): [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone this repository:

```
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/gql-plants.git
  cd gql-plants
```

2. Install project dependencies using Yarn:

```
  yarn
```

3. Start the GraphQL server and json-server:

```
  yarn json-server
  yarn dev
```

This will start the GraphQL server and json-server on their default ports: 4000 for GraphQL and 3001 for json-server.

4. Access the GraphQL interface in your web browser:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000/graphql to access the GraphQL interface. From here, you can interact with the API and run queries and mutations.
